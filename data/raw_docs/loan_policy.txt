Loan Approval Policy

This document describes the standard loan approval process used by the bank to ensure prudent credit decision-making, regulatory compliance, and risk control.

1. Loan Application
Customers submit a loan application including basic personal or corporate information, loan purpose, amount, and tenure.

2. Document Collection
Required documents are collected, including:
- Identity documents
- Income or financial statements
- Business licenses (for corporate loans)
- Collateral-related documents (if applicable)

3. KYC and AML Screening
Customer identity is verified according to KYC requirements.
AML checks are performed against sanction lists, PEP lists, and adverse media.
Applications failing KYC/AML checks are rejected or escalated.

4. Credit Assessment
Credit bureau reports are retrieved and analyzed.
Key indicators include repayment history, debt ratio, and existing exposures.

5. Credit Limit and Pricing
Based on risk assessment, a credit limit is proposed.
Loan pricing (interest rate, fees) is determined according to internal risk-based pricing rules.

6. Approval Workflow
- Standard cases follow automated or rule-based approval.
- Non-standard or high-risk cases are submitted to the Credit Approval Committee.
- Exception approvals must be documented with justification.

7. Loan Disbursement
After approval and contract signing, funds are disbursed to the borrower.
All disbursement conditions must be satisfied.

8. Post-Loan Management
Ongoing monitoring includes repayment behavior, covenant checks, and risk signals.
Early warning triggers may lead to review or intervention.

This policy ensures consistency, transparency, and traceability in loan approval decisions.
