Credit Risk Management Manual

This manual outlines key principles and mechanisms for managing credit risk throughout the loan lifecycle.

1. Risk Rating
Borrowers are assigned internal credit ratings based on quantitative and qualitative factors.
Ratings influence approval authority, pricing, and monitoring intensity.

2. Credit Exposure and Limits
Credit limits are set at borrower, group, and portfolio levels.
Exposure must comply with regulatory and internal concentration limits.

3. Collateral and Guarantees
Collateral types include cash, property, and other acceptable assets.
Haircuts are applied based on liquidity and volatility.
Guarantees are assessed independently.

4. Exception Handling
Any deviation from standard credit policy requires exception approval.
Exceptions must include documented rationale and compensating controls.

5. Review and Re-Assessment
Credit facilities are subject to periodic review.
Material changes in borrower risk profile trigger reassessment.

6. Independent Review Mechanism
Credit decisions are subject to independent review by risk management units.
Separation of business origination and risk approval is enforced.

This manual supports prudent lending by embedding risk controls into credit decisions.
